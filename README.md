The goal of the project is to create a Function as a Service system. 
It would be a Controller who has n Invokers. Then with a Policy Manager, when the controller recieves some Actions to do will send the Actions to the Invokers. 

We are going to add MultiThreading on our code. Also, we are going to apply different dessign patterns to improve our code and reduce repated code.
